\section{Introduction}
The $^{\text{Po}}$Cat-Lektron AOCS analysis includes a comprehensive simulation model to support the design,
verification, and validation of the attitude and orbit control system for the $^{\text{Po}}$Cat-Lektron mission. 
Developed at the UPC NanoSat Lab as part of the IEEE OpenPocketQube Kit initiative and selected for the ESA Fly 
Your Satellite! program, the mission comprises two 1P PocketQubes equipped with L-band and K-band radiometers for 
remote sensing and RFI monitoring.\\

\noindent The simulation campaign evaluates key operational modes, such as Nadir Pointing and Detumbling, 
assessing performance against mission requirements. Results demonstrate the impact of sensor noise and external disturbances, 
and highlight the effectiveness of advanced estimation techniques like the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in improving attitude 
determination and meeting pointing accuracy objectives. This simulation framework provides critical insights for the successful 
implementation of the AOCS in the $^{\text{Po}}$Cat-Lektron

\subsection{The \texorpdfstring{\textsuperscript{Po}}CCat-Lektron mission}

\subsubsection{Mission statement}

The $^{\text{Po}}$Cat-Lektron is a mission resulting from the IEEE OpenPocketQube Kit initiative, 
developed at the UPC NanoSat Lab. The mission has been selected in the 4th call of 
the ESA Fly Your Satellite! (FYS) program. The mission analysis presented corresponds 
to the $^{\text{Po}}$Cat-Lektron mission. It consist of two 1P PocketQubes, the PoCat-2 and the 
PoCat-3, developed as a part of the IEEE OpenPocketQube Kit. This mission aims to 
demonstrate the feasibility of PocketQube platforms for remote sensing applications.\cite{wiki}
\paragraph{}
The payloads on board of the PocketQubes are two passive radiometers to be use for 
RFI purposes on K and L bands. Apart from the remote sensing nature of the mission, 
this mission also aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the PocketQube platforms to 
create, manage and join Federated Satellite Systems. To do so, the FSS Experiment 
will be reproduced as a part of the experiments of the mission.

\subsubsection{Mission Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Demonstration of Scientific Viability:} Demonstrate the feasibility of 
    conducting scientific missions using PocketQube platforms. To do so, the mission
    proposes collecting valuable RFI data through a K-Band and L-Band passive 
    radiometers (One for each PocketQube). The payloads will monitor interferences on 
    these bands. This data will facilitate enhanced detection and the generation of
    heatmaps indicating RFI distribution across the globe. In this experiment we aim
    to obtain data on the K-Band to see the impact on the atmospheric water vapor 
    measurements, and in the L-Band the interferences over the Position Navigation 
    and Timing (PNT) signals.

    \item \textbf{Satellite Federation Concept:} To establish and demonstrate that 
    PocketQube platforms can create, manage and join Federated Satellite System 
    (FSS). This proof of concept for this resource-limited platforms is based on 
    the reproduction of the FSS Experiment conducted at the UPC NanoSat Lab. The 
    demonstration consist on create a federation between 2 PocketQubes, in order 
    to download data. Previous missions such as the FSS-Cat from the UPC NanoSat 
    Lab demonstrated the feasibility of this opportunistic collaboration using 6U 
    CubSats.

    \item \textbf{Educational Development:}  As a mission developed at the UPC NanoSat
     Lab, the mission is oriented for undergraduated students to gain experience and 
     get involved in real space missions. In addition, several Bachelor and Master 
     Thesis had been done from this project, apart from the academic papers that 
     this project has produced.
