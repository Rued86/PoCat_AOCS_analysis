\section{Introduction}
The $^{\text{Po}}$Cat-Lektron Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) analysis includes a comprehensive simulation model to support the design,
verification, and validation of the AOCS for the $^{\text{Po}}$Cat-Lektron mission. 
Developed at the UPC NanoSat Lab (UPC NL) as part of the IEEE OpenPocketQube Kit (OPQK) initiative and selected for the ESA Fly 
Your Satellite! (FYS) program, the mission comprises two 1P PocketQubes (PQ) equipped with L-band and K-band radiometers for 
remote sensing and Remote Frequency Interference (RFI) monitoring.\\

\noindent The simulation campaign evaluates key operational modes, such as Nadir Pointing and Detumbling, 
assessing performance against mission requirements. Results demonstrate the impact of sensor noise and external disturbances, 
and highlight the effectiveness of advanced estimation techniques like the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in improving attitude 
determination and meeting pointing accuracy objectives. This simulation framework provides critical insights for the successful 
implementation of the AOCS in the $^{\text{Po}}$Cat-Lektron

\subsubsection{Mission statement}

The $^{\text{Po}}$Cat-Lektron is a mission resulting from the OPQK initiative, 
developed at the UPC NL. The mission has been selected in the 4th call of 
the ESA FYS program. The mission analysis presented corresponds 
to the $^{\text{Po}}$Cat-Lektron mission. It consist of two 1P PQs, the PoCat-2 and the 
PoCat-3, developed as a part of the OPQK. This mission aims to 
demonstrate the feasibility of PQ platforms for remote sensing applications.\cite{wiki}
\paragraph{}
The payloads on board of the PQs are two passive radiometers to be use for 
RFI purposes on K and L bands. Apart from the remote sensing nature of the mission, 
this mission also aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the PQ platforms to 
create, manage and join Federated Satellite Systems (FSS). To do so, the FSS Experiment 
will be reproduced as a part of the experiments of the mission.

\subsubsection{Mission Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Demonstration of Scientific Viability:} Demonstrate the feasibility of 
    conducting scientific missions using PQ platforms. To do so, the mission
    proposes collecting valuable RFI data through a K-Band and L-Band passive 
    radiometers (One for each PQ). The payloads will monitor interferences on 
    these bands. This data will facilitate enhanced detection and the generation of
    heatmaps indicating RFI distribution across the globe. In this experiment we aim
    to obtain data on the K-Band to see the impact on the atmospheric water vapor 
    measurements, and in the L-Band the interferences over the Position Navigation 
    and Timing (PNT) signals.

    \item \textbf{Satellite Federation Concept:} To establish and demonstrate that 
    PQ platforms can create, manage and join FSS. This proof of concept for this resource-limited platforms is based on 
    the reproduction of the FSS Experiment conducted at the UPC NL. The 
    demonstration consist on create a federation between 2 PQs, in order 
    to download data. Previous missions such as the FSS-Cat from the UPC NL 
    demonstrated the feasibility of this opportunistic collaboration using 6U 
    CubSats (CS).

    \item \textbf{Educational Development:}  As a mission developed at the UPC NL,
     the mission is oriented for undergraduated students to gain experience and 
     get involved in real space missions. In addition, several Bachelor and Master 
     Thesis had been done from this project, apart from the academic papers that 
     this project has produced.
